Scripts for Computational Physics simulations - Numerical Methods for Differential Equations & Large Monte Carlo Simulation.

Here you will find scripts corresponding to my work in the Computational Physics module from the University of Manchester. 'Project 2' corresponds to the use of 4 different numerical methods to solve the differential equations of a driven damped harmonic oscillator. 'Project 3' corresponds to the simulation of thousands of neutrons interacting with a containment wall using Monte Carlo and Woodcock methods.
