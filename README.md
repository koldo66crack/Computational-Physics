Scripts from computational physics module.

Here you will find scripts corresponding to my work in the Computational Physics module from the University of Manchester. 'Project 2' corresponds to the use of 4 different numerical methods to solve the differential equations of a driven damped harmonic oscillator. 'Project 3' corresponds to the simulation of thousands of neutrons interacting with a containment wall using Monte Carlo and Woodcock methods.
